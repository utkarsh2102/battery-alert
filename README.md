# Battery-Alert

Battery Alert is a shell script that is written to notify the user about the current battery status so that they never run out of charging.

With this script, the user neither has to worry about leaving the device on charge nor while they are working.

The script will notify you to **Put-On Charging** when the battery is low and **Remove Charging** when the system is done charging.
